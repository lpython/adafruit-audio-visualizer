## Adafruit Aduio Visualizer
### Modified for Itsy bitsy

![final](images/final_cad.png)

- Caution: Its a tight fit and I wouldn't recommend. Made this because adafruit was out of stock with long lead time. If you do use it, make the compartment taller to account for solder joints.
- Used pins A1 and A3 for PDM clock and data lines.
